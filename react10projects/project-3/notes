will create use state line 5 now will creat randon number generate function
will change image wile clicking  in img src will add javascriptand template littralls  
  <!-- <img src={`/images/dice_1.png`} alt="dice" /> -->
  after this add $ symbol in dice_${currentDice} ro change dices

  will remove usestate from numberelectore and add in gameplay then will pass selectore as a props in numberselectore component
  and will go to gameplay comp and addprops in numberselector  see 14,15 line
  hum ne state ko ek level upper laya ta ki sara logic el me use karsake
  will do same for the roledice comp take usestate and pase in gameplay comp and will pass this as a propss in roledice
  in game comp will add in role dice

  it wil give props vaalidation error in role component ans number component will leave that for now

  how to update totoal score
  from role comp create score usestate and i will coppy generateRandomNumber roleDice function and pase in gameplay
    <!-- </div>
      <RoleDice CurrentDice={CurrentDice}
      roleDice={roleDice}/> -->
       then pass props in roledice
now i will add check in gameplay comp
if (selectedNumber === randomNumber){
    setScore((prev)=>prev  + randomNumber)
  }else{
    setScore((prev)=>prev - 2)
  }
  
  if we click on number it is selecting the same number after refresh so for that
   setSelectedNumber(undefined)

   now tje number is not selected but the dice is rolling to stop that
     if (!selectedNumber) return; 
     we are showing this at first in role function so dice should not rotate and 

     now will show error saying select the number
     creating error use sstate in gameplay
