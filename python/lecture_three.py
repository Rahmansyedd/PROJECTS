# lsit methods:
# append method means joining at last
# append list:  otner one is mutating the list

# list=[2,1,3]
# list.append(4)
# print(list)

# sort method :arrange in assending or desending
# list=[2,1,3]
# print(list.append(4))
# print(list.sort(reverse=True))
# print(list) 

# reversed method
# list=[2,1,3]
# list.reverse()
# print(list)

# inster method
# list=[2,1,3]
# list.insert(3,7)
# print(list)

# remove method :it will rempve the value pop will delete the value
# list=[2,1,3,1]
# list.pop(2)
# print(list)

# tuples in python :immuatable  we can change the values will us ()barkets
# in tuple we have to add comma to single value because python will take it as a int so we need to add comma(1,) then it will take as a tuple
# tup =(2,3,1)
# print(type(tup))
# print(tup[0])
# print(tup[1])
# print(tup)
# tup[1] = 2  we cant di ths bcoz it is immuatble

# slice in tulpes:

# tup=(1,2,3,4)
# print(tup[1:4])

# mothod in python:
# index method  count method
# tup =(1,2,3,34,34)
# # print(tup.index(2))
# print(tup.count(34))
